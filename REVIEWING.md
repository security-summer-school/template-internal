# Reviewing contributed CTF challenges

## Challenges

You will make sure that challenges are of good quality:

- Difficulty is properly set.
- The topic of the challenge is appropriate.
- The solution provided is working.
- Vulnerability and explanations are easy to understand.

## Working on Pull Requests

You will review contributions as pull requests.
Contributions will need to follow the [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Add your review as comments and request for changes to the PR until everything is ready to be approved.
Before approving the PR, make sure that all Github Actions tests ended successfully.
Once approved, either you or someone with proper access rights can use `Rebase and merge` to merge the PR commits and integrate the contribution.
